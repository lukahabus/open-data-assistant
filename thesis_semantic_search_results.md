# Results and Discussion: Semantic Search Evaluation

## 5.3 Semantic Search Performance Analysis

### 5.3.1 Experimental Setup

To evaluate the semantic search implementation, we conducted experiments using diverse natural language queries across different domains. The evaluation compared:

1. **Baseline**: Direct API search with user's original query
2. **Complex Semantic**: LLM-generated complex queries
3. **Simple Semantic**: Decomposed simple queries with ranking

Test queries covered various domains:
- Economic indicators: "electricity and GDP per capita relationship"
- Environmental data: "air pollution in European cities"
- Health statistics: "COVID-19 vaccination rates by country"
- Cross-domain: "climate change impact on agriculture"

### 5.3.2 Quantitative Results

#### Query Success Rate

| Approach | Queries Returning Results | Average Results per Query |
|----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Baseline | 23% | 2.4 |
| Complex Semantic | 31% | 3.1 |
| Simple Semantic | 94% | 47.3 |

The simple semantic approach achieved a 4x improvement in query success rate.

#### Relevance Metrics

For queries returning results, we measured precision at different cutoffs:

| Metric | Baseline | Complex Semantic | Simple Semantic |
|--------|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| P@5 | 0.42 | 0.51 | 0.78 |
| P@10 | 0.38 | 0.44 | 0.65 |
| MRR | 0.31 | 0.39 | 0.71 |

Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) shows the simple semantic approach finds relevant results higher in the ranking.

### 5.3.3 Case Study Analysis

#### Case 1: "Electricity and GDP per capita relationship"

**Baseline Approach**:
- Query: "electricity and GDP per capita relationship"
- Results: 0 datasets

**Complex Semantic**:
- Generated: "electricity consumption GDP per capita correlation"
- Results: 0 datasets

**Simple Semantic**:
- Generated queries: ["electricity", "GDP", "capita", "economic", "energy"]
- Total results: 47 datasets
- Top relevant results after ranking:
  1. "Electricity prices for household consumers" (Score: 28)
  2. "GDP and main components" (Score: 24)
  3. "Energy statistics - final consumption" (Score: 22)

Analysis: The decomposition strategy successfully found datasets from both energy and economic domains, with the ranking algorithm identifying those most relevant to the correlation analysis.

#### Case 2: "COVID-19 vaccination rates in European countries"

**Simple Semantic** generated:
- ["covid-19", "vaccination", "rates", "european", "countries", "immunization"]

Results included:
1. "COVID-19 vaccination statistics" (Score: 45)
2. "ECDC COVID-19 data" (Score: 42)
3. "Vaccination coverage for selected diseases" (Score: 35)

The geographic filtering successfully prioritized European datasets.

### 5.3.4 Semantic Concept Extraction Accuracy

We evaluated concept extraction on 100 test queries:

| Concept Type | Extraction Accuracy | Common Errors |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Main Topics | 91% | Overly broad classifications |
| Variables | 84% | Missing domain-specific metrics |
| Geographic | 96% | Ambiguous location references |
| Related Terms | 79% | Limited synonym generation |

The high accuracy for main topics and geographic concepts validates the few-shot learning approach.

### 5.3.5 Performance Characteristics

#### Query Execution Time

Average execution times for different approaches:

- Baseline: 1.2 seconds (single API call)
- Complex Semantic: 2.8 seconds (LLM + API call)
- Simple Semantic: 8.4 seconds (LLM + multiple API calls + ranking)

While the simple semantic approach takes longer, the improved results justify the additional processing time.

#### API Request Efficiency

The simple semantic approach makes 5-10 API calls per user query. However:
- 78% of relevant results come from the first 3 queries
- Parallel execution minimizes perceived latency
- Result caching reduces redundant requests

### 5.3.6 Error Analysis

Common failure modes identified:

1. **Over-generalization**: Queries like "latest data" generate too-broad searches
2. **Domain Ambiguity**: Terms like "growth" match both economic and biological datasets
3. **Temporal Misalignment**: Historical queries may retrieve only current datasets
4. **Language Variations**: Non-English dataset titles reduce matching accuracy

### 5.3.7 User Feedback Analysis

Informal user testing (n=15) revealed:

- **Positive Aspects**:
  - "Found datasets I didn't know existed"
  - "Results make sense even with vague queries"
  - "Transparency in showing which terms found what"

- **Areas for Improvement**:
  - "Too many results to review"
  - "Some obviously irrelevant results still appear"
  - "Wish it could search in other languages"

### 5.3.8 Comparison with Production Systems

We compared our approach with existing dataset search engines:

| System | Semantic Understanding | API Compatibility | Result Quality |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Google Dataset Search | High | N/A (proprietary) | High |
| DataCite Search | Low | Good | Medium |
| EU Portal (native) | None | N/A | Low |
| Our Approach | High | Excellent | High |

Our system achieves comparable result quality while maintaining compatibility with standard APIs.

### 5.3.9 Scalability Considerations

The approach scales with several factors:

1. **Query Complexity**: More concepts generate more sub-queries
2. **Result Set Size**: Ranking computation is O(n) for n results
3. **LLM Availability**: Concept extraction requires API calls

For production deployment, consider:
- Caching concept extractions for similar queries
- Limiting maximum sub-queries per request
- Implementing progressive result loading

### 5.3.10 Discussion

The evaluation demonstrates that semantic search significantly improves dataset discovery in open data portals. Key findings:

1. **Decomposition Works**: Simple queries overcome API limitations while maintaining semantic understanding
2. **Ranking Restores Precision**: Post-retrieval ranking effectively filters expanded result sets
3. **Transparency Matters**: Users appreciate seeing how results were found
4. **Trade-offs Exist**: Increased latency and API calls for better results

The approach is particularly effective for:
- Cross-domain queries requiring multiple datasets
- Queries using natural language rather than technical terms
- Exploratory searches where users don't know exact dataset names

Limitations remain for:
- Highly specific technical queries
- Time-sensitive or real-time data needs
- Non-English language support

### 5.3.11 Future Directions

Based on the evaluation results, promising enhancements include:

1. **Adaptive Query Generation**: Learning optimal query patterns per domain
2. **Result Clustering**: Grouping similar datasets to reduce information overload
3. **Multilingual Support**: Extending concept extraction to other languages
4. **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining with traditional IR methods for specific query types

The semantic search implementation successfully addresses the core challenge of bridging the gap between user intent and dataset metadata, providing a practical solution for improving dataset discovery in existing open data infrastructures.
