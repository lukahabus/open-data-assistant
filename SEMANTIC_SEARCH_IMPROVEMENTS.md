# Semantic Search Improvements for Dataset Assistant

## Overview

The dataset assistant has been significantly improved with semantic analysis capabilities that use few-shot prompting to better understand user queries and generate multiple **simple** search queries that are then combined and ranked.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Semantic Concept Extraction

The new system extracts semantic concepts from user queries using few-shot prompting:

- **Main Topics**: Core subjects the user is interested in
- **Variables**: Specific data points or indicators
- **Geographic Focus**: Location-based requirements
- **Related Terms**: Alternative terminology that might be used

### 2. Simple Query Generation

Instead of complex queries that often return 0 results, the system now:
- Breaks down concepts into simple, single-word or short-phrase queries
- Generates 5-10 simple search terms based on semantic concepts
- Examples: "electricity", "GDP", "energy", "economic" instead of "electricity consumption GDP per capita correlation"

### 3. Search and Combine Strategy

The new approach:
1. Executes multiple simple searches in parallel
2. Collects all unique results from different queries
3. Combines results into a single pool
4. Applies semantic ranking to identify most relevant datasets

### 4. Intelligent Relevance Ranking

Results are ranked based on:
- Word-level matching of main topics (8 points per word, +4 for title match)
- Word-level matching of variables (4 points per word)
- Related term matches (2 points)
- Co-occurrence bonus (15 points if multiple main topics appear together)
- Synergy bonus (5-10 points for matching multiple concepts)
- Penalty for known irrelevant results (-20 points)

## Example: Before vs After

### Query: "give me all datasets about how electricity and GDP per capita are related"

**Before (Complex Queries):**
```
Generated query: "electricity consumption GDP per capita correlation"
Results: 0 datasets found
```

**After (Simple Queries):**
```
Generated queries:
1. electricity
2. capita
3. economic
4. development
5. consumption
6. production
7. energy
8. GDP

Each query finds 5-10 datasets
Combined pool: 30-50 unique datasets
After ranking: Top 10 most relevant datasets about electricity and GDP
```

## Why Simple Queries Work Better

1. **API Limitations**: The EU Open Data Portal API works better with simple search terms
2. **Broader Coverage**: Simple queries cast a wider net to find related datasets
3. **Flexibility**: Datasets might use different terminology than expected
4. **Ranking Handles Relevance**: The semantic ranking ensures only relevant results are shown

## Implementation Details

### Simple Query Generation Algorithm

```python
# Extract individual words from concepts
"electricity consumption" → ["electricity", "consumption"]
"GDP per capita" → ["GDP", "capita"]

# Combine key terms
["electricity", "GDP"] → "electricity GDP"

# Use simple terms that are likely to match
```

### Ranking Algorithm

The ranking system:
1. Scores each dataset based on concept matches
2. Rewards co-occurrence of related concepts
3. Penalizes known irrelevant results
4. Filters out low-scoring datasets (threshold: 5 points)

## Usage

The improvements are automatically applied when using the interactive assistant:

```bash
python interactive_dataset_assistant.py
```

The system will:
1. Extract semantic concepts from your query
2. Generate multiple simple search queries
3. Execute searches and combine results
4. Rank by semantic relevance
5. Present the most relevant datasets

## Testing

Run the demo script to see the simple query approach in action:

```bash
python demo_simple_queries.py
```

This demonstrates how simple queries find more results than complex ones, and how ranking identifies the most relevant datasets.
