# Progress: Open Data Assistant

## What Works

-   **Core Query Pipeline (Manual CoT):** The `answer_complex_query` function in `sparql.py` successfully orchestrates a multi-step process:
    -   Takes a natural language query.
    -   Generates an initial SPARQL query using an LLM (`generate_sparql_query`).
    -   Executes the SPARQL query against the EU Open Data Portal (`execute_sparql_query`).
    -   Handles execution errors and empty results by triggering an LLM-based self-correction analysis (`analyse_with_llm`) and retrying generation with refined context.
    -   Analyzes successful results using an LLM (`analyse_with_llm`) to assess dataset relevance, coverage, and linking potential.
    -   Selects candidate datasets based on the analysis.
    -   Handles cases with no suitable candidates via a self-correction loop.
    -   Optionally generates a linking hypothesis for multiple candidates using an LLM (`analyse_with_llm`).
    -   Handles low linking feasibility via a self-correction loop.
    -   Synthesizes a final JSON response summarizing the findings using an LLM (`analyse_with_llm`).
-   **LLM Analysis Function:** The `analyse_with_llm` function successfully calls the OpenAI API for various analysis tasks, requesting and generally receiving structured JSON output.
-   **SPARQL Execution:** The `execute_sparql_query` function reliably sends queries and retrieves JSON results or handles HTTP/JSON errors.
-   **Basic Examples:** The script runs through a set of example queries, demonstrating the end-to-end flow (as seen in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block output).

## What's Left to Build / Refine

-   **Langchain Refactoring:** Potentially refactor the manual CoT orchestration into a Langchain Agent for better structure, maintainability, and potentially more robust state/error handling.
-   **Testing & Evaluation:** Conduct more extensive testing with diverse and challenging queries to evaluate the reliability and accuracy of SPARQL generation, LLM analysis, and self-correction.
-   **Prompt Engineering:** Refine LLM prompts for all stages (generation, analysis types) based on testing outcomes.
-   **Error Handling Robustness:** Improve handling of unexpected LLM outputs or edge cases in SPARQL results.
-   **Output Formatting:** Improve the final output format beyond the current JSON structure for better end-user readability (part of the synthesis step or a subsequent presentation layer).
-   **User Interface:** Develop a user interface (e.g., Streamlit, FastAPI) to interact with the assistant.
-   **Performance Optimization:** Analyze potential bottlenecks (LLM calls, SPARQL execution time).

## Known Issues

-   **Manual CoT Fragility:** The current manual orchestration in `answer_complex_query` might be complex and potentially brittle compared to using a dedicated framework like Langchain.
-   **Failed Langchain Edit:** The attempt to apply the Langchain refactoring automatically failed, requiring manual intervention or further attempts if pursued.
-   **Metadata Limitations:** The analysis relies solely on dataset metadata. Linking hypotheses are speculative and may not reflect the actual joinability of the data content.
-   **LLM Reliability:** The quality of SPARQL queries and analysis depends heavily on the LLM's understanding and adherence to prompts. Occasional suboptimal queries or analyses are possible.
-   **SPARQL Endpoint Limits:** Complex queries might hit execution time or resource limits on the public endpoint.
