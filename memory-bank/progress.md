# Progress: Open Data Assistant

## What Works

-   **Core Query Pipeline (Langchain Agent):** The `ask_data_portal_agent` function in `sparql.py` successfully uses a Langchain `AgentExecutor`:
    -   Takes a natural language query.
    -   Utilizes `generate_sparql_tool` (which calls `gpt-4o` with a 5s timeout) to create SPARQL queries.
    -   Utilizes `execute_sparql_tool` (which calls the SPARQL endpoint with a 5s timeout) to run queries.
    -   The agent's internal logic (guided by its system prompt) handles errors (like timeouts, bad syntax) and empty results by analyzing the tool output and potentially retrying generation with added context.
    -   The agent analyzes successful results (metadata) and synthesizes a final natural language answer.
-   **Structured Logging:** The script logs detailed information about each run (NLQ, context, SPARQL generated, execution status, results/errors, final answer, tracebacks) to both the console and a unique timestamped file in the `logs/` directory.
-   **API Timeouts Configured:** Timeouts for the LLM calls (`ChatOpenAI`) and SPARQL endpoint HTTP requests (`requests`) are explicitly set to 5 seconds.
-   **Langchain Tools:** The `@tool`-decorated functions (`generate_sparql_tool`, `execute_sparql_tool`) encapsulate the core functionalities for SPARQL generation and execution.
-   **Basic Examples:** The script runs through an expanded set of example queries (including more complex ones) in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, demonstrating the end-to-end agent flow.

## What's Left to Build / Refine

-   **Timeout Evaluation & Tuning:** Monitor the impact of the 5-second timeouts. Increase if they prove too restrictive for reliable operation.
-   **Testing & Evaluation:** Conduct more extensive testing with diverse and challenging queries to evaluate the reliability and accuracy of the agent's SPARQL generation, tool usage, error handling, and final synthesis. Use logs for analysis.
-   **Prompt Engineering:** Refine the agent's system prompt and potentially the prompt within `generate_sparql_tool` based on testing outcomes to improve reasoning, error recovery, and result quality.
-   **Error Handling Robustness:** Further improve the agent's ability (via prompt refinement) to handle and recover from various tool errors or unexpected SPARQL results.
-   **Learning from Logs (Active):** Potentially implement mechanisms for the agent to ingest and learn from past interactions recorded in the logs (e.g., to improve SPARQL generation based on past successes/failures).
-   **Output Formatting:** Improve the final output format beyond the agent's text response for better end-user readability (potentially as part of a UI layer).
-   **User Interface:** Develop a user interface (e.g., Streamlit, FastAPI) to interact with the assistant.
-   **Performance Optimization:** Analyze potential bottlenecks (LLM calls, SPARQL execution time, agent reasoning steps).

## Known Issues

-   **Aggressive Timeouts:** The current 5-second timeouts for API calls might lead to frequent failures for complex SPARQL queries, slow LLM responses, or during peak load times on external services.
-   **Metadata Limitations:** The analysis relies solely on dataset metadata retrieved via SPARQL. Linking hypotheses are speculative and may not reflect the actual joinability of the data content.
-   **LLM Reliability:** The quality of SPARQL queries and the agent's reasoning depends heavily on the LLM's understanding and adherence to prompts. Occasional suboptimal queries or decisions are possible.
-   **SPARQL Endpoint Limits:** Complex queries might hit execution time or resource limits on the public EU Open Data Portal endpoint, irrespective of the client-side timeout.
