# Active Context: Open Data Assistant

## Current Focus

Integrating and refining the core logic for processing natural language queries into SPARQL for the EU Open Data Portal. The primary implementation resides in `sparql.py`.

## Recent Changes

-   Implemented a manual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) orchestration (`answer_complex_query` in `sparql.py`).
-   This orchestration includes steps for:
    -   SPARQL generation (`generate_sparql_query` using OpenAI).
    -   SPARQL execution (`execute_sparql_query`).
    -   LLM-based analysis of results/failures (`analyse_with_llm` using OpenAI) for metadata review, linking hypothesis, self-correction context, and final answer synthesis.
    -   Self-correction loops for handling execution errors, empty results, unsuitable candidates, and low linking feasibility.
-   The changes implementing this manual CoT were accepted into `sparql.py`.
-   An attempt was made to refactor this manual CoT logic using the Langchain framework (specifically an AgentExecutor). However, the automated code application tool failed to apply the necessary changes to `sparql.py`.
-   The `requirements.txt` file has been created/updated, listing necessary dependencies including `openai`, `requests`, and `langchain` libraries.

## Current State

-   The active code in `sparql.py` uses the manually implemented CoT orchestrator (`answer_complex_query`) and direct OpenAI API calls (`analyse_with_llm`).
-   The Langchain refactoring is *not* currently reflected in the `sparql.py` code due to the failed application of the edit.

## Next Steps & Considerations

1.  **Address Langchain Refactoring:**
    *   Option A: Retry the Langchain refactoring, potentially by providing the code directly for manual application if the tool continues to fail.
    *   Option B: Continue development using the current manual CoT implementation in `sparql.py` if Langchain integration proves problematic or isn't a priority.
2.  **Testing & Evaluation:** Thoroughly test the current `answer_complex_query` function with a wider range of complex queries to assess robustness and identify areas for prompt/logic improvement.
3.  **Refine Prompts:** Review and refine the prompts used for SPARQL generation (`generate_sparql_query`) and the various analysis steps (`analyse_with_llm`) for better accuracy and efficiency.
4.  **Error Handling:** Enhance error handling, particularly for edge cases in LLM responses or SPARQL results.
5.  **Interface:** Consider how this logic will be integrated into a user-facing application (e.g., Streamlit, FastAPI).

## Important Patterns & Preferences

-   Use Chain-of-Thought reasoning for complex tasks involving multiple steps and potential failures.
-   Employ LLMs for specific analysis tasks within the chain (metadata analysis, linking, synthesis, failure analysis).
-   Incorporate self-correction loops based on execution results or LLM analysis.
-   Request structured JSON output from LLMs for easier parsing and integration.
-   Prioritize finding relevant *datasets* rather than directly answering questions requiring deep data analysis within the datasets themselves (at this stage).
